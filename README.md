Personal Website Project for  Web Systems and Interfaces class.

Originally was intended to be a Rubin-vase multi-stable version, but I failed with formatting.
Now it's just css for wide/small screens version and simple animations I haven't tried to add before.
I have tried to make it under ADA compliancy rules instead of infinite <div> and <p> blocks
